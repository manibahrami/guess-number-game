# Guess the Number 🎯

This is a simple Python console game where the program randomly selects a number and the user has to guess it.

The goal of this project was to practice basic programming concepts such as:
- Working with variables and conditions
- Using loops
- Getting user input
- Handling simple game logic

## How the game works

- The program generates a random number within a defined range
- The user tries to guess the number
- After each guess, the program gives feedback (too high / too low)
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed

## Why this project?

This project was created as a beginner-friendly exercise to strengthen logical thinking and control flow in Python.  
It focuses on writing clean and readable code rather than complex features.
